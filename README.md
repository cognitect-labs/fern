# fern

Fern is a simple but useful language for data. While you
can use Fern to read any kind of trusted data, Fern has semantics
that make it extremely useful for configuration data.

## Usage

Fern data is stored in the form of EDN, specifically an EDN map with symbols
for keys. Here, for example, is a simple Fern file:

~~~
{host "localhost"
 timeout 4000}
~~~

The thing that makes Fern Fern is that it provides a way
for one part of a Fern file to reference another. The
syntax for recursively evaluating a symbol in Fern is
identical to the Clojure dereference syntax. For example,
let's imagine that what you really need is to configure
three servers. Each server listens on a different port, but
all happen to be on the same host and use the timeout value.
In this case, the Fern configuration might look like:

~~~
{host "localhost"
 timeout 4000
 server-1 {:host @host :request-timeout @timeout :port 8000}
 server-2 {:host @host :request-timeout @timeout :port 8010}
 server-3 {:host @host :request-timeout @timeout :port 8020}}
~~~

Specifically the rules of Fern evaluation are:

* Any dereferenced symbol, either `(clojure.core/deref a-symbol)` or `@a-symbol` is recursively evaluated by Fern.

* Any value quoted in the ordinary Clojure way (either with an explicit `(clojure.core/quote some-expression)` or using a quote `'some-expression`) will evaluate to the inner expression. Thus, if you wanted to include a dereferenced symbol in your Fern data, you would write `'@foo`. If you wanted to included a quoted symbol in your Fern data you would simply double up on the quotes: `'(clojure.core/quote something-quoted)'`.

* Any value of the form `(lit _symbol_ arg1 arg2...)` is replaced by the result of doing a *Clojure* evaluation of `(fern/literal _symbol_ arg1 arg2 arg3...)`.

* Anything else just evaluates to itself. So `[1 foo :bar]` evaluates to a three element vector containing a number, a symbol and a keyword.

## API

Fern provides two levels of API. The core Fern API is defined in the
`fern` namespace, while the in the `fern.easy` namespace you will
find a number of convenience functions that make reading a Fern file
relatively painless. For example, `fern.easy/file->environment`
takes a path and reads the fern file at that path and returns the Fern
environment:

~~~
(require 'fern.easy)

(def e (fern.easy/file->environment "example.fern"))
~~~

Once you have a fern environment, you can use `fern/evaluate` to pull values out of it:

~~~
(require 'fern)

(def server-1-map (fern/evaluate 'server-1)
~~~

## Plugins

Fern lets you add new methods for the `fern/literal`
multifunction. You just define those in your namespaces in the
[usual way](https://clojure.org/reference/multimethods). But there's a
catch because you need to require those namespaces before calling
`fern.easy/evaluate`.

Fern provides a short cut for that. The function
`fern.easy/load-environment` is just like
`fern.easy/file->environment` but it takes a second argument. That
will be a symbol in the Fern file whose value is a collection of
namespaces to require.

For example, if you have this file:

~~~
{plugins  [example.templates]
 host "localhost"
 timeout 4000
 server-1 {:host @host :request-timeout @timeout :port 8000}
 server-2 {:host @host :request-timeout @timeout :port 8010}
 server-3 {:host @host :request-timeout @timeout :port 8020}

 home     (lit example/template {:key "home.mustache"}) }
~~~

Then you can call fern like this:

~~~
(require 'fern.easy)

(def e (fern.easy/load-environment "example.fern" 'plugins))
~~~

The `(lit example/template ,,,)` expression is going to call the
`fern/literal` multifunction with the arguments
`['example/template {:key "home.mustache"}]`. Using the `plugins`
symbol allows Fern to require a namespace ("example.templates") that
defines the multimethod.

## Reporting Errors

Fern offers an easy way to print errors. If you get an exception from
`fern/evaluate`, `fern.easy/load-environment`, or
`fern.easy/validate!`, you can call
`fern.easy/print-evaluation-exception` to print out a nicely formatted message.
